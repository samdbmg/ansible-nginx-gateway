    # Usually you'll proxy an internal site and this webserver will be it's canonical location, so the `Host` header
    # should match the server name. However sometimes you'll want to transparently proxy to an external site, in which
    # case you need `use_proxy_host: True`. Mostly this is useful for the unit tests!
